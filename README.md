1. Press on windows button + r and go to %localappdata%
2. Go to "FortniteGame" Folder
3. Navigate over to Saved > Config > WindowsClient
4. Replace the current GameUserSettings.ini with the one in this repository.

This is in the Tutorial.txt file.

+ These settings are more focused on performance that visuals.
+ The *lowest* possible settings you could get with fortnite to ensure you have the best performance while gaming.
+ Decent for low end Laptops/PCS
+ Drastically better in terms of performance than the stock settings.
+ The GameUserSettings.ini file is safe, you can turn it into a .txt file and look into it if you believe there's any type of malware.
  
IMPORTANT
if this messes up your fortnite and stretches, open the file up and go to resolution and change it to your native resolution


NOTE: i haven't updated this since fortnite ch5 s1, im unaware if there are changes in the current game user file but im pretty sure if you use the file it will still import the settings that haven't been changed throughout the updates.
